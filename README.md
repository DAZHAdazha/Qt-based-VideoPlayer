## 2.3 Scenarios

### 2.3.1 Scenario1

1\. Background

\(1\) The typical user: Philip Freestone

\(2\) The needs of users / urgent need to solve the problem:

a\. Philip Freestone: There are massive quantities of video of different kinds.

b\. Philip Freestone: A large personal video library which can organize videos is required.

\(3\) Assumptions:

a\. The classification function of the library has been completed

2\. The scene

Philip wants to organize videos. First of all, he adds a custom tag. He clicks "Add Tag" button, then a window pops up, where he types a tag name in the "Name" input and clicks "OK" button. As a result, the tag is appended in the tag list, which can be modified by double-clicking. Secondly, he adds a video under this tag. He clicks the add file icon, then a window pops up, where a video's information is required. For "Video path" input, he clicks "Open" button, then a file dialog pops up. He selects a video file of the local computer which he wants to organize and clicks "open" to upload it. For "Filmed at" input, he clicks a date in the calendar. For "Location" and "Memory" input, he types the place where the video was shot and the memo about the video separately. Finally, he clicks "OK" button, then the video's information including cover, name, date, location and memo is displayed in the video library of the tag chosen. After that, he adds a variety of tags and videos following the same steps as before, organizing massive quantities of video of different kinds. Ultimately, he clicks a radio button, "Name", videos are sorted where names are in alphabetical order, instead of in the order in which to add. Then, he clicks a radio button, "Date", videos are sorted in chronological order.

### 2.3.2 Scenario2

1\. Background

\(1\) the typical user: Philip Freestone

\(2\) the needs of users/urgent need to solve the problem

a\. Philip Freestone: The library allows to view videos.

 (3) Assumptions:

a\. The play function of the library has been completed

2\. The scene

Philip wants to view the video. He double clicks a video in the library, then a player pops up, the video starts playing and the playlist of the corresponding tag is shown on the right, with the current and total playing time of it displaying at the bottom. Then he enlarges the video to the whole screen size by clicking the full-screen icon and presses Esc to exit. After that, he clicks the pause button to pause the video, and clicks the same button, play, continuing playing it. While viewing the video, he drags the volume slider to adjust the volume of the player, and clicks the volume icon, going silent. In addition, He watches the video in different multiples of speed by choosing the options in the drop-down list, such as 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5 and 2. He also fasts forward and rewinds the video 10s by clicking the corresponding buttons, and drags the progress bar to view an arbitrary position he wants. What's more, he changes videos by clicking the previous and next button to the previous and next video in the playlist, and by double-clicking a video in the playlist to a random video. Inside the playlist, he clicks add file icon and remove icon to add and remove a video file. Finally, he clicks the "Library" button to change to the library page.

# 3. The targeted platform

The platform we are targeted is desktop.

# 4. Cycle 1

## (i) Prototype

### (a) The goal of this cycle

The goal of this cycle is to implement some primary functions of the original player. On the one hand, the preview of the video at the bottom will be changed from random to the sequence. On the other hand, the elementary functions, such as play, pause, volume and progress bar will be added.

### (b) Name of prototyping technique and software

The prototyping technique used is sketched through PowerPoint.

### (c) The motivation of the design shown in the prototype

The prototype of this fundamental video player is designed to improve the basic functionality of this page during the period of finding an appropriate solution for the layout design of video player and preview bar. The basic functionality and layout of this page is very important due to that the primary requirement of the video player is to display a usable and stable user interface. The stable video player interface supports **the affordance principle and signifier principle from Norman's principles for interface design** because it enable users to control the running of video player by using the visible widgets like buttons and slider, feedback principle also be take into consideration by connecting the real-life volume change and video playing progress change with interactive slider. This provides the video player basic video play function while avoiding the previous chaotic and uncontrollable state. In tom's original version the content in the preview bar was displayed randomly with flashing animation which is chaotic and can easily distracting users instead of make them focusing on the video, so we changed the logic of how the preview bar works.

### (d) The reason for the chosen technique

Sketch allows to quickly export ideas without getting bogged down in aesthetic details.

### (e) Evidence of the design

![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/2.png)

## (ii) Evaluation

### (a) The name of the evaluation technique

The evaluation technique used is the heuristic evaluation.

### (b) The reason why this technique was chosen

This cycle focuses more on the whole of the player. It pays attention to implementing primary functions of the player, so the interaction between users and the player is not complex, does not need to be detailed. Therefore, heuristic evaluation is used to identify usability issues and improve the player.

### (c) The outcomes of the evaluation

This player mainly violated four of the ten heuristics. First of all, the system status is not visible. While a video is playing, the progress slider does not move and there are no accurate values of the video's lengths showing beside the progress bar. Secondly, some facts do not match between system and the real world. On the one hand, when the player is launched, the video starts to play automatically and repeatedly without volume, and users may not understand that the slider on the right is used to control the volume. On the other hand, the video playlist of the player is at the bottom and keeps changing. Secondly, the player lacks user control and freedom. There is no full-screen operation. Users are not able to view the video at a different speed, switch video through clicking some previous and next button, and load their own video to watch. Lastly, the design is not aesthetic and minimalist. The play and pause buttons are represented by text instead of icons.  

### (d) Evidence of the evaluation

## (iii) Code

### (a) Changes compared to the previous version

The video name is cycle 1.

### (b) The link to a code repository for this cycle

[<span class="underline">https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/releases/tag/Cycle1</span>](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/releases/tag/Cycle1)

### (c) The differences between prototype and implementation 

There are no differences between the prototype and the implementation. Because the primary functions are not complex, all of the designs in prototype, play, pause, progress bar, volume slider and video preview are implemented successfully.

# 5. Cycle 2

## (i) Prototype

### (a) The goal of the cycle

In this cycle, we mainly targeted to polish the design of the video player,  including improving the design of the player, enhancing its functionality, and optimizing its visual effects and user interaction logic. We designed the layout of the video player part with more significant control buttons and more information to display. The whole layout of this video player page was also redesigned by unifying the layout of widgets to enhance the integration of the whole page.

### (b) Name of the prototyping technique and software 

The prototyping software is Axure.

### (c) The motivation of the design shown in the prototype

To meet the usability goals of HCI, that is

-   effective to use (effectiveness)

-   efficient to use (efficiency)

-   safe to use (safety)

-   having good utility (utility)

-   easy to learn (learnability)

-   easy to remember how to use (memorability),

the prototype of the advanced video player in this cycle is designed to improve the functionality of the video player. The fully functional video player is the foundation of our product because we plan to implement a video management library, in which the video play function is one of the most basic but important functions. It enables users to browse their videos within one software instead of opening a third-party software. Therefore, a series of video control widgets were added into the player which covers almost all requirements about video play control, including speed control widget specially designed for our target user, outdoor enthusiasts. In this way, they can browse long videos and enjoy every wonderful moment in their videos carefully. Due to that, the visual design of the player will directly influence the user\'s experience on this software. We arranged the sequence of widgets to match users' operation logic and added accessible icons for every button as the substitution of boring text button. Moreover, to meet Norman\'s principles for ID, the open button has high-level feedback. Namely, a new page including the directory of the current computer will be shown. Other buttons all have low-level feedback, such as showing dark grey when the button is clicked. The design of random preview of videos in the previous cycle caused conflict when we add new video and the layout of it and logic is inappropriate, so we removed it from this page to free space for better layout arrangement of video player and control widgets.

### (d) The reason for the chosen technique

This prototype technique helps us to design a visualized prototype with intuitionistic layout suggestion and icon illustrations which further facilitate the developer\'s implementation process.

### (e) Evidence of design

![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/4.png)

## (ii) Evaluation:

### (a) Name of the evaluation method

The name of the evaluation method is cognitive walkthrough.

### (b) Why choose the technique

Primarily, this method involves going through a series of steps in a certain scene, paying attention to the possible problems and the concrete and details. Moreover, CW evaluates specific user tasks and is to find usability problems by tracking users\' psychological processing through the completion of tasks, not the whole interface characteristics. The cycle2 involves many functions of the player. Therefore it is more suitable to use a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate the implementation.

### (c) The outcomes of the evaluation

1. After choosing a video to play, the continue button is needed to be clicked to play the video. It is not obvious that the video can be played.

2. It is not entirely obvious that the video has been loaded. A playlist may be needed to show the videos to play.

3. The button icon meaning of fast forward 15s and back forward 15s are not entirely obvious. It may be better to replace the two buttons with some icons with more explicit meaning.

4. There are too many player controls on the same line. It may be better to put some buttons to somewhere else.

### (d) Evidence of the evaluation

Task: Add some videos to the playlist and try the basic functions of a normal player.

Cognitive walkthrough Steps:

1. click the open button

2. Choose and open some videos to add to the playlist

3. Click the pause button

4. Click the continue button

5. Drag the progress bar to some different time

6. Drag the volume to some different volumes

7. Click the mute button

8. Click the last video button

9. Click the next video button

10. Click the changing speed button

11. Choose some different speeds

12. Click the fast forward for 15 seconds button

13. Click the back forward for 15 seconds button

14. Click the Full-Screen button

15. Exit the full-screen mode

 

The table shown below is the evaluation process of the cognitive walkthrough method, in which correct action, perform, associate and interpret corresponds to the following three questions respectively:

1\. Will the users know which is the correct action?

2\. Will the user notice how to perform the correct action?

3\. Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly?


## (iii) Code

###  Video

The video name is cycle2.

### (b) The link to a code repository for this cycle

[<span class="underline">https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlaye/releases/tag/cycle2</span>](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlaye/releases/tag/cycle2.1)

### (c) Differences between prototype and implementation

The implementation totally obeys with the design prototype because the cycle implemented basic functions of the player, such as pause, continue, full screen, mute button, fast/back forward for 15 seconds and so on.

# 6. Cycle 3:

## (i) Prototype 

### (a) The goal of this cycle

To meet the **usability goals of HCI**, that is

-   effective to use (effectiveness)

-   efficient to use (efficiency)

-   safe to use (safety)

-   having good utility (utility)

-   easy to learn (learnability)

-   easy to remember how to use (memorability),

the goal of this cycle is to implement a video list which is embedded in the video player page. It provides a fundamental overview and primary management function for the added videos. Moreover, this video list will also be connected to another manage page to receive information and display the overview of videos in the tagged list.

### (b) Name of prototyping technique and software

The prototyping technique used is sketched through the Axure prototype design.

### (c) The motivation of the design

The prototype of the embedded video list layout is designed to improve the convenience when a user wants to manage multiple videos added currently. The convenience of management of current inserted videos is very important, because of the requirement that users should easily switch the playing videos to any other videos they want with some simple operations. This requirement shows that the visualized container which consists of currently added videos is indispensable. Due to the requirements and previous video player implementation, we designed a video list in the video player for users to quickly switch videos by just one click instead of opening videos one by one and clicking next button many times. According to the consistent principle, the spacing between different videos is consistent. In order to improve the users' experience of interacting with the video list, we added the static image preview for all added videos. The function enables users to intuitively understand the content of the videos by directly looking at the preview image and quickly selecting their target video when the name of the video is ambiguous. Some iconic button widgets were added into the video list to provide better management of the video list. The tag bar was also added into this video player page which will be connected to another library page. The library page will be used to support the display function of the video type. Moreover, to meet Norman\'s principles for ID, the open button has high-level feedback. Namely, a new page including the directory of the current computer will be shown. Other buttons all have low-level feedback, such as showing dark grey when the button is clicked. 

### (d) The reason for the chosen technique

The sketch can be easily changed and improved. The difference between the prototype of cycle 3 and that of cycle 2 is only adding a playlist not modifying the existing functions, so it is convenient to draw the prototype of cycle 3 based on the cycle2 by sketching.

## (ii) Evaluation

### (a) Name of the evaluation technique

The evaluation technique used is the cognitive walkthrough.

### (b) The reason why this technique was chosen

This cycle pays more attention to one specific function, playlist. In order to evaluate it, it is better to break relevant tasks into a series of steps and walk through them, in order to identify problems and causes. Cognitive walkthrough is used to detect and evaluate specific user's tasks, by tracking the user\'s mental processing during the user\'s completion of the task to identify usability problems.

### (c) The outcomes of the evaluation

There are three tasks associated with the playlist function. Suppose that users are familiar with computer operations, after breaking tasks into series of steps and walking through each step with three evaluating questions, all of the tasks were completed successfully, but two of them have some problems. One is in task 1 when adding a video into the playlist, there are five steps and each of them was evaluated in the table below. The problem of step one is a user might not notice how to click the add file icon, because it is not obvious what this icon means. It is recommended to add the mouse over information to it. The other is task 2. For task 2, there are two ways to play a video in the playlist, but one of them, double-clicking one video might not succeed because the user might not know that it can play the video, compared to clicking the play icon. It is also suggested to add a hint when the mouse moves on a video.

The video name is cycle3

### (b) The link to a code repository for this cycle

<https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/releases/tag/cycle3>

### (c) Differences between prototype and implementation 

As mentioned before, this cycle is aimed to implement a playlist embedded in the player age and classify all of the videos by tags which connect to another new manage page. During implementation, the former was achieved successfully, which allows users to check and manage the videos. However, the latter was not implemented. Since it is hard to classify videos and even create a new page to manage them, and the project of it is so huge that it can be the next cycle, a test tag was placed as a motivation for the next cycle.

# 7. Cycle4:

## (i) prototype 

### (a) The goal of this cycle

To meet the usability goals of HCI,  that is

-   effective to use (effectiveness)

-   efficient to use (efficiency)

-   safe to use (safety)

-   having good utility (utility)

-   easy to learn (learnability)

-   easy to remember how to use (memorability),

the goal of this cycle is mainly on implementing the fundamental of visualized video management library for the user to better manage their videos. This library not only contains detailed previews with extra information of every video in the list but also includes some editable widgets, which enable users to customize some displayed information of particular videos. In this cycle, we are devoted to constructing a video library which not only records videos and relative information but also evokes user's memory of that meaningful experience when they look back to these videos.

### (b) Name of prototyping technique and software

Quick UI prototype was used to do the prototyping.

### (c) The motivation of the design

The prototype of the video repository part of this video library programme is designed to improve the capability of video management after we've implemented the fundamental video player functions. The capability in video management is one of the most significant properties of the system, due to the requirement that users demand to explore and organize the large personal video library. This requirement indicates that users not only watch these videos through this programme but also manage videos as they wish to look back on particular vivid memories in the future. Thus we designed a new page for the demonstration of video management. It contains all preview of added videos with corresponding customizable information to display the date and the location the video was filmed, and the noted special feeling of the experience behind particular video from users. This new video repository page avoids adding more widgets to the list part of the video player page, so as to reduce the unnecessary complexity of that page and improve user's interaction experience. In terms of visual design for better usability, We use the F group layout to organize the layout of the page.

![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/7.png)

*F group layout*

Due to the various customizable information that the repository can display, we used a new window for users to add a new video. In the new window, users can easily input and select these video information, instead of many input boxes that congest together. This largely reduces the complexity of the video management library and improves the visual effect of this page.

### (d) Reason for the chosen technique

It is quick to design a prototype from scratch using the QT quick UI prototype. Moreover, while brainstorming tends to result in frustration and overthinking, rapid prototyping forces you to think less and idea faster, unleashing creativity in exciting ways. Additionally, it boosts focus and team togetherness. Working closely with a wide range of team members and stakeholders reveals your team's strengths and weaknesses. It also turns every success into shared merit, boosting team spirit and morale. This type of collaboration often results in heightened focus and motivation, driving teams to do their best work in the quickest time.

## (ii) Evaluation

### (a) The name of the evaluation technique

The evaluation technique used is the cognitive walkthrough.

### (b) Reason why this technique was chosen

This cycle only focuses on one function of the library, adding and displaying videos. In order to identify its problems as well as causes, it is better to break this task into a series of steps and walk through them one by one. It is cognitive walkthrough that is used to detect and evaluate specific user task, through tracking users'mental activity while they are performing the task, to identify usability problems.

### (c) Outcomes of the evaluation 

Most steps of the task were completed successfully, while three of them failed in answering perform question, will the user notice how to perform the correct action. First of all, when the user tried to click add file icon, they would not find the correct icon quickly, because this icon is not quite common, and it does not have mouse over information, which may not obvious what the icon means, and violates the tenth principle, help and documentation, in Nielsen's ten heuristic principles. Secondly, for step 2, clicking on "Open", when the user tried to add video path, there are two locations the user might try clicking, text field and "Open" button. However, when the user tried to click them, only the button highlights and clickable. Finally, step 7, clicking on a date has medium severity, because when the user tried to click on one date of the calendar, nothing happened, which also does not satisfy the first principle, visibility of system status, in Nielsen's ten heuristic principles

### (a) Video

The video name is cycle4 in the video folder.

### (b) The link to a code repository for this cycle

<https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/releases/tag/cycle4>

### (c) Differences between prototype and implementation

There are no differences between the prototype and the implementation. As expected in prototype, we implemented video repository part of the video management library in a new page, which contains the cover of the video, the date and the location of the video, and a memo of the video. We used a new window for users to add a new video where users can easily input and select video information.

# 8. Cycle5

## (i) Prototype 

### (a) The goal of this cycle

The goal of the cycle 5 mainly aims at implementing a tag bar and structure a backend relational database to connect each tag with corresponding videos and to provide a real, local-based and stable management service which memorize user's operation and store customized information. Every tag corresponding to a particular video repository implemented in the previous cycle where users can add or delete videos. 

![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/9.png)

*Database schema*

### (b) Name of prototyping technique and software

QT designer is used to do the prototyping.

### (c) Motivation of the design

To meet the **user experience goals and usability goals** of HCI, the prototype of the tag bar was designed to improve user's experience in video management when user wants to classify their videos based on personal criteria. Classification is a very important section of management because our target users, the outdoor enthusiasts, have the desire to manage a huge video library that contains videos about various types of outdoor activities. If users can classify each series of videos by tag the type of activities in videos, they can quickly find videos they want to browse next time. Moreover, this tag function also encourages them to film more videos to fill each tag and inspire them to develop new types of activities and record in the library. Thus, we designed the tag bar for users. According to **the consistent principle**, the spacing between each tag is consistent. However, the tag bar caused a failure about the interaction between the tag bar and videos in previous cycle's video repository that users cannot add videos to the repository of any tags. In this situation, we deployed an SQLite database in the backend which used to memorize the relationship between tags and each video and store information about tag and videos. The database support not only connects the tag bar with the repository that makes every video have at least one tag for identification but also upgrades the whole programme and make it possible for the system to provide local-based, consistent and stable management service.

### (d) The reason for the chosen technique

Qt allows programmers to design a program in pure C++ code without any design tools. But more programmers are more accustomed to designing programs in a visual environment, especially when designing interfaces. This is because this design is more in line with the habit of human thinking, and it is much faster than writing code. Another advantage of using Qt designer is that it gives programmers great freedom to modify their own forms, and they don\'t have to force themselves to modify the source code.

### (e) Evidence of the design

![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/10.png)

## (ii) Evaluation

### (a) The name of the evaluation technique

Questionnaire is used in the evaluation.

### (b) Reasons why this technique was chosen

A questionnaire is needed in the cycle to evaluate the video play system since most of its functions have been. We need to present the video play system to as more as targeted people as possible, in order to collect their opinions. With their advice, we can further improve the system. One of the advantages of the questionnaire survey is that it can save time, manpower and physical strength. Secondly, the questionnaire survey results are easier to quantify. Questionnaire survey is a structured survey method, in which the form of a survey, the sequence of questions, and the giving of answers are all fixed and expressed in words. Therefore, this method is easy to quantify. Thirdly, the results of the questionnaire survey are easier to be statistically processed and analyzed. Fourthly, the advantage of the questionnaire survey is that it can conduct a large-scale survey. In addition, if privacy issues are involved in the questionnaire, the way of signature may cause the respondents to be unwilling to express their true wishes, while the questionnaire survey in the non-anonymous state can be without scruple.

9\. What are the unmet needs?(multiple choice)

<span class="chart">![images](https://github.com/DAZHAdazha/Qt-based-VideoPlayer/blob/version-1/images/19.jpg)</span>

According to the questionnaire result, nearly half of the interviewees are outdoor enthusiasts and have the habit of shooting and collecting videos. More than two thirds of them think the system interface friendly and easy to operate. Some of them think the video management information provided by the system is incomplete. But more them 80% of them think that the system meet their current personal video collection, statistics and management requirements. The top four aspects of the interface they find unattractive or ambiguous are the size of player controls, the tag list, the video window, the color schema. The top two aspects of the unmet needs some video sorting method, video classification.

### (c) Differences between prototype and implementation

1.  Some video sorting method were added, such as descending or ascending videos.

2.  The play controls were modified to be smaller.

3.  The search function was not implemented successfully because in order to simplify the development, a component in Qt is used to render database data, but this component is difficult to support search.

# 9. Cycle6

## (i) Prototype

### (a) The goal of this cycle. 

To meet the **desirable aspects of user experience goal** in HCI, such as satisfying, enjoying, pleasurable, helpful, and **avoid the undesirable aspects**, that is boring, frustrating, unpleasant, annoying, the goal of this cycle is mainly targeted on connecting the video management library page with the video player page and optimizing the visual effect of the page and the user interaction experience. We will access both pages into the database and build appropriate logic relation between two pages. Besides, the colour system of the UI is designed to fully meet the basic principles of colour application, which is consistent, distinct and intentional. The sorter also is introduced to improve functionality.

### (b) Name of prototyping technique and software

Card were used to do the prototyping with the assistance of Photoshop.

### (c) Motivation of the design

The prototype of this cycle was designed to improve the consistency of pages and usability of this programme. The consistency of pages is very important because it reduced the cognitive overhead of using the programme for the first time. The reduce of cognitive overhead supports the internal consistency principle from Norman's interaction design principles while avoiding the previous problem that the functionality between two pages is separate and the information of video list cannot be transmitted between which cause the functional isolation of two pages. Under the support of backend SQLite database with underneath functions, the video list of video player page will receive and handle video information from currently stayed vide repository when users jump from the library page. The usability of the whole programme is also significant because it largely decides the users' interactive experience on this programme. In detail, the F group layout and consistent spacing improved the usability by providing better content reading experience, also the deep blue colour theme allows content to be easily read without distraction, and photographic avatars to be easily seen. This supports both affordance and signifier principles while avoiding previous problems in the video management library page.

### (d) The reasons for the chosen technique

The card with Photoshop can form the independent content structure by borderline, shadow, background colour and other characteristics, and distinguish it from other content by a margin, thus forming its unique design advantages. Mainly includes the following aspects:

1\. Establish a clearer page structure

Compared with borderless design or dividing line layout, the card can be used for information induction and combination, which can divide a clearer organizational structure and simplify the processing of complex contents. At the same time, the margin card form is beneficial to the expansion of the scene

2\. Highlighting key information

The greatest advantage of card design is the integrity created by boundaries. On the one hand, users can perceive the belonging level of content; on the other hand, users can enhance their perception of content through the background color of cards.

3\. Multi-layer nesting improves space utilization

As an independent information collection container, the card has the characteristics of colonial expansion and superposition in XYZ three directions, which can improve the utilization rate of space.

## (ii) Evaluation

### (a) Name of the evaluation technique

The evaluation technique used is the interview.

### (b) Reasons why this technique was chosen.

This cycle is the last cycle of our library, so there is an urgent need to check whether users' requirements are met, whether users can use the library correctly and whether they like the visual design of the library, to identify new issues and problems and improve the library. Therefore, we interviewed a single person with sample scenarios of use and prototypes.

### (c) The outcomes of the evaluation

For the most part, the system interface is user-friendly, enjoyable and satisfying, but in some ways, it is not. The library has a beautiful and concise design, and the signifiers' meaning is explicit; it provides error prevention in some ways and allows users to exit the process at any time. In addition, the feedback of operations is easy to understand. However, in some aspects, it is also unfriendly. For example, there is no mouseover information providing help. It does not have message boxes confirming operations, and it is not able to help users identify, analyze and correct errors, resulting in adding repeat videos and tags. Furthermore, it is not effective and efficient enough to use, without support keyboard shortcuts, right-click shortcut menu, and the location input of Add New Video popover cannot be auto-filled or selected; the videos' information displayed by the system is also not complete, without the lengths of videos, and they cannot modify information of videos. Last but not least, it does not meet some video management requirements, where users cannot delete existing custom tags and videos from the library and are not able to remove a video from one tag to another.

### (d) Evidence of the evaluation

Interview note:

1\. Q: When you use the product, do you feel enjoyable and satisfied?

A: Not very pleased.

2\. Q: Is the product easy to learn and remember how to use?

A: Yes. Your scenarios use a language that is consistent with my habits and familiarity, and they follow real-world conventions, where information appears in a natural and logical order.

3. Q: Is the signifiers' meaning of our product explicit?

A: Yes. The library follows the tradition of the platform, having consistent language and icons, such as play, pause, fast forward, fast backward, previous, next, full screen, volume slider, progress bar, add file and delete.

4. Q: Whether you like the visual design of the library?

A: Yes. It has a beautiful and concise design. First of all, the appearance of the library is consistent with the design style, both in color and icons. For example, information for the same icon in different windows is the same, such as add file icon and tag icon. Secondly, the design of pop-up windows also makes the interface aesthetic and minimalist.

5. Q: Is the feedback of operations easy to understand?

A: Yes. The library let me know what is going on with appropriate feedback over a reasonable amount of time. For example, when I try to click a button, it will highlight when mouse over and mouse down.

                  

6. Q: Is the system interface friendly and easy to operate?

A: For the most part, the system interface is user-friendly. The signifiers' meaning of the library is explicit, so their effects are predictable, and it has a beautiful and concise design. At the same time, the feedback of operations is easy to understand. In addition, it allows me to exit the process at any time. For example, I can close the pop-up windows by clicking "Cancel" button or "×" icon. What's more, if I accidentally closed one window by mistake, I can click "Library" button in play page to reopen manage page of the library or double click a video in manage page to reopen play page of the library. Finally, the library can prevent error taking place. In Add New Video popover, the "OK" button is not abled until a video file is uploaded.

However, in some ways, it is also unfriendly. For example, there is no mouseover information providing help. In addition, it does not provide error prevention to ask me to reconfirm if I want to do this, and it cannot help me identify, analyze and correct errors, resulting in adding repeat videos and tags.

7. Q: Is the system effective and efficient enough to use?

A: No, it does not support keyboard shortcuts and right-click shortcut menu. What's more, the location input of Add New Video popover cannot be auto-filled or selected.

8. Q: Is the video management information provided by the system complete?

A: No, the lengths of videos are not provided.

9\. Q: Can the system meet the current personal video collection, statistics and management requirements? What are the unmet needs?

A: Not completely. I cannot delete existing custom tags and videos from the library, and I cannot remove a video from one tag to another. Furthermore, I cannot modify information on videos.

### (c) Differences between prototype and implementation

Compared to the prototype, implementation has some differences. Repeat videos and tags will be added without error identification, prevention and correction. The system does not support keyboard shortcuts and right-click shortcut menu, and the location input of Add New Video popover cannot be auto-filled or selected. Last but not least, users are not able to delete existing custom tags and videos from the library, modify information of videos, or remove a video from one tag to another. 

# 10. The ethics statement

We complied with the university regulations for ethical research on humans as following.

It is well known that outdoor enthusiasts are keen on shooting and recording their experiences, and collect massive quantities of videos from action cameras, video drones and mobile phones. The video typically from a variety of locations is of different lengths, ranging from a \"moving photo\" of a few seconds to 3 hours of raw skiing footage, and activities, such as cycling, parascending, football and skiing. Therefore, we aimed to explore a large personal video library for outdoor enthusiasts, which allow them to manage and view their own videos.

First of all, we were intended to carry out an online evaluation, in order to develop a wonderful personal video library for outdoor enthusiasts. Participants will be involved in the evaluation for almost 30 minutes including using the video library and completing a questionnaire online.

Since it is designed for outdoor enthusiasts, we chose participants who are fond of outdoor sports, with different genders and ages, in order to get more straightforward and comprehensive feedbacks. Based on their feedback, we could analyze it quantitively and qualitatively, in order to improve the video library better. Therefore, the personal data we collected is gender and age range, and we did not collect any sensitive personal data includes the following types of information about an identifiable living individual: racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual life; commission of offences or alleged offences. In addition, on screening questionnaires, we grouped the exclusion criteria so that a single yes or no answer can be given, to avoid participants having to specify which exclusion criteria apply. This also reduced the sensitivity of the data and was less likely to cause embarrassment for research participants. 

Before collecting research data, we read the legal requirements for collecting and processing personal data carefully. Based on the fact that if participants are provided with enough information about the questionnaire for them to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate, it may be sufficient for consent to be implied by the questionnaire being completed and returned, we made the information sheet and consent form to ensure that participants are asking for appropriate consent for the intended use of the data collected, where all research participants will be told about how any personal data collected about them will be used, stored, processed, transferred and destroyed.

At the same time, based on the fact that for questionnaires that pose a minimal risk to participants having an introductory paragraph that contains the same sort of information as the consent form, such as voluntary participation, risks, confidentiality or anonymity, and right to withdraw, is usually sufficient, we made an opening statement for our online questionnaire:

You are being invited to participate in a research study titled a large personal video library for outdoor enthusiasts. This study is being done by, Cheng Yuhui, Feng Yunjia, Liang Minghao, Li Shuyao, Zhang Hanrong from the University of Leeds.

The purpose of this research study is exploring a large personal video library for outdoor enthusiasts, which allow them to manage and view their own videos, and will take you approximately 30 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time without it affecting any benefits that you are entitled to in any way. You do not have to give a reason. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to.

We believe there are no known risks associated with this research study; however, as with any online related activity, the risk of a breach is always possible. To the best of our ability your participation in this study will remain confidential, and only anonymised data will be published. We will minimise any risks by retaining your identifiable personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, and retain your data in the anonymized or pseudonymized format.

Secondly, we considered any data protection, data security and other ethical issues, because we were intended to obtain research data from the online questionnaire. Our survey information collected online was done in a manner that complies with the Data Protection Act, specifically that if the survey is collecting data that is personally identifiable then the data must be held anonymously. Many surveys were conducted anonymously and as such the data is classified as non-sensitive.

We only collected the minimum amount of personal data which we needed for our purposes, and used it fairly and transparently, for research in the public interest, or to support the work of our organization. At the same time, we kept a record of our processing activities, making it clear to individuals what their data will be used for, how it will be handled and what their rights are. The project-specific information will include more detail about how your data will be used.

In addition, we only retained participants' identifiable personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for and retained their data in anonymized or pseudonymized format. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data we considered the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we processed their personal data and whether we could achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We have put in place security measures to prevent their personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way and will notify them and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we were legally required to do so.

All the contact information that we collected about participants during the course of the research was kept strictly confidential and stored separately from the research data. We took steps wherever possible to anonymize the research data so that you would not be identified in any reports or publications.

Finally, the signed consent forms would be stored and arranged in place appropriate for the long term as these contain personal data relating to the research participants.
